# Hexed Industries

Start up website design company. I have decided to create a live website including domain and hosting to help understand the whole process. The website is a basic shell to experiment with diffrent styles and themes and allow me to generate logos, titles and background using vector art. The website will grow and become more coherant along with my skills. I imagin once this course is over I will re-write a large amount of the code in an attempt to clean it up and stream line it along with finding way to improve load times. 
 
## UX

The site is simple in structure and doesnt currently directly sell anything. it does give a user the opportunity to veiw Hexed Industries with future development letting me both show case what I can do along with giving information on previous projects as well as other services i can provide.

If a user wanted to send me a message there is a section in the footer on every page.

if a user wanted to veiw my Cv it is easy to find in the header. a pdf version is also easy to locate within this section.

I didnt use a wire frame to help me design this site

## Features

The site is basic currently, it has 4 main pages consiting of content with one page conatining a CV style borrowed from the previous elements completed. It also contains a contact me section.
 
### Existing Features

the plan for the future is to use hexed industries as an unbrella for diffrent work streams for my skill sets including automotive, climbing coaching and design as well as any that i may want to grow my intrest in. I will use the website to create these sections as mini companies the can display their services.

I would like to use java to provide some animation as well as the possability of using 3d artwork on the page.


## Technologies Used

I wrote this site on Visual Studio

I completed the grpahic work on Affinity Designer

I used Bootstrap to help with the structure and functionality of the site

I used google fonts for the font type

I used Font awesome for some icons

I used some stock pictures from google that had permsion to be used and plan to replace tehm with art work of my own shortly


- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
