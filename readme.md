# Hexed Industries

Start up website design company. I have decided to create a live website including domain and hosting to help understand the whole process. The website is a basic shell to experiment with diffrent styles and themes and allow me to generate logos, titles and background using vector art. The website will grow and become more coherant along with my skills. I imagin once this course is over I will re-write a large amount of the code in an attempt to clean it up and stream line it along with finding way to improve load times. 
 
## UX

The site is simple in structure and doesnt currently directly sell anything. it does give a user the opportunity to veiw Hexed Industries with future development letting me both show case what I can do along with giving information on previous projects as well as other services i can provide.

If a user wanted to send me a message there is a section in the footer on every page.

if a user wanted to veiw my Cv it is easy to find in the header. a pdf version is also easy to locate within this section.

I didnt use a wire frame to help me design this site

## Features

The site is basic currently, it has 4 main pages consiting of content with one page conatining a CV style borrowed from the previous elements completed. It also contains a contact me section.
 
### Existing Features

the plan for the future is to use hexed industries as an unbrella for diffrent work streams for my skill sets including automotive, climbing coaching and design as well as any that i may want to grow my intrest in. I will use the website to create these sections as mini companies the can display their services.

I would like to use java to provide some animation as well as the possability of using 3d artwork on the page.


## Technologies Used

I completed the grpahic work on Affinity Designer
